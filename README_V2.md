# Brand Audit V2 - Real Data Only

## Major Improvements in V2

### üö´ No Fallback Data
- **Zero tolerance for fake data** - If extraction fails, we report it as failed
- **No default values** - No placeholders, no generic content
- **Transparent failures** - Clear indication of what couldn't be extracted

### üîÑ Multi-Strategy Extraction
```python
# Tries multiple methods before giving up
1. BeautifulSoup (fast, basic HTML)
2. Selenium (JavaScript rendering)
3. Playwright (modern SPAs)
```

### üåê Industry-Agnostic
- **Dynamic industry detection** - AI determines industry from content
- **Adaptive prompts** - Adjusts analysis based on detected context
- **No hardcoded assumptions** - Works for any brand/industry

### üìä Enhanced Quality Control
- **Extraction quality scoring** (0-100%)
- **Confidence scores** for each field
- **Validation at every step**
- **Content verification** against source

### ü§ñ Improved AI Analysis
- **Better prompt engineering** with step-by-step reasoning
- **Multiple prompt strategies** with retry logic
- **Structured output** using function calling
- **Model selection** based on content complexity

## V2 Components

### 1. Enhanced Brand Profiler V2
```python
from enhanced_brand_profiler_v2 import EnhancedBrandProfilerV2

profiler = EnhancedBrandProfilerV2()
result = profiler.analyze_brand("https://example.com")

if result['status'] == 'success':
    print(f"Company: {result['brand_data']['company_name']}")
    print(f"Quality: {result['extraction_quality']:.0%}")
else:
    print(f"Failed: {result['error']}")
```

### 2. Competitive Grid Generator V2
```python
from competitive_grid_generator_v2 import CompetitiveGridGeneratorV2

generator = CompetitiveGridGeneratorV2()
report = generator.generate_report(
    urls=["https://brand1.com", "https://brand2.com"],
    report_title="Market Analysis"
)
```

### 3. AI-Powered Competitive Intelligence V2
```python
from ai_powered_competitive_intelligence_v2 import AIPoweredCompetitiveIntelligenceV2

intelligence = AIPoweredCompetitiveIntelligenceV2()
report = intelligence.generate_report(
    urls=["https://competitor1.com", "https://competitor2.com"],
    report_title="Competitive Intelligence"
)
```

## Example Output

### Successful Extraction
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "url": "https://stripe.com",
  "extraction_method": "selenium",
  "brand_data": {
    "company_name": "Stripe",
    "brand_positioning": "The financial infrastructure for the internet",
    "key_messages": [
      "Accept payments online",
      "Scale globally", 
      "Developer-first platform"
    ],
    "confidence_scores": {
      "company_name": 0.95,
      "positioning": 0.90,
      "overall": 0.88
    }
  },
  "extraction_quality": 0.88
}
```

### Failed Extraction
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "error": "No content could be extracted",
  "extracted_data": null
}
```

## Report Features

### Grid Report
- **Quality indicators** for each brand
- **Confidence badges** on extracted data
- **Failed extractions section** with reasons
- **No placeholder content**

### AI Intelligence Report
- **16:9 slide format** with navigation
- **Data quality indicators** throughout
- **SWOT analysis** from real content
- **Cross-brand insights** when multiple brands analyzed
- **Extraction summary** showing success/failure rates

## Best Practices

1. **Handle failures gracefully** - Check status before using data
2. **Monitor quality scores** - Higher scores = more reliable data
3. **Review confidence scores** - Low confidence may need manual verification
4. **Use appropriate timeouts** - Some sites load slowly
5. **Respect rate limits** - Don't overwhelm target sites

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Chrome/Chromium for Selenium
- Playwright browsers (`playwright install`)
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements_v2.txt
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Limitations

- Cannot extract from:
  - Password-protected sites
  - Sites requiring authentication
  - Sites with aggressive anti-scraping
  - Heavily obfuscated content
  
- Extraction quality depends on:
  - Site structure and semantics
  - Content clarity
  - Technical implementation

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Computer vision for logo detection
- [ ] Advanced color extraction from images
- [ ] Social media integration
- [ ] Historical data tracking
- [ ] API endpoint detection
- [ ] Performance metrics extraction
